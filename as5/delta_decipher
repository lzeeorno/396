CRYPTOGRAPHY OR CRYPTOLOGY IS THE PRACTICE AND STUDY OF TECHNIQUES FOR SECURE
COMMUNICATION IN THE PRESENCE OF THIRD PARTIES CALLED ADVERSARIES. MORE GENERALLY,
CRYPTOGRAPHY IS ABOUT CONSTRUCTING AND ANALYZING PROTOCOLS THAT PREVENT THIRD
PARTIES OR THE PUBLIC FROM READING PRIVATE MESSAGES; VARIOUS ASPECTS IN
INFORMATION SECURITY SUCH AS DATA CONFIDENTIALITY, DATA INTEGRITY,
AUTHENTICATION, AND NON-REPUDIATION ARE CENTRAL TO MODERN CRYPTOGRAPHY.
MODERN CRYPTOGRAPHY EXISTS AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE DISCIPLINES OF MATHEMATICS,
COMPUTER SCIENCE, ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, COMMUNICATION SCIENCE, AND PHYSICS.
APPLICATIONS OF CRYPTOGRAPHY INCLUDE ELECTRONIC COMMERCE, CHIP-BASED PAYMENT
CARDS, DIGITAL CURRENCIES, COMPUTER PASSWORDS, AND MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS.

CRYPTOGRAPHY PRIOR TO THE MODERN AGE WAS EFFECTIVELY SYNONYMOUS WITH ENCRYPTION,
THE CONVERSION OF INFORMATION FROM A READABLE STATE TO APPARENT NONSENSE. THE
ORIGINATOR OF AN ENCRYPTED MESSAGE SHARES THE DECODING TECHNIQUE ONLY WITH
INTENDED RECIPIENTS TO PRECLUDE ACCESS FROM ADVERSARIES. THE CRYPTOGRAPHY
LITERATURE OFTEN USES THE NAMES ALICE FOR THE SENDER, BOB FOR THE
INTENDED RECIPIENT, AND EVE FOR THE ADVERSARY. SINCE THE
DEVELOPMENT OF ROTOR CIPHER MACHINES IN WORLD WAR ONE AND THE ADVENT OF COMPUTERS
IN WORLD WAR TWO, THE METHODS USED TO CARRY OUT CRYPTOLOGY HAVE BECOME
INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND ITS APPLICATION MORE WIDESPREAD.

MODERN CRYPTOGRAPHY IS HEAVILY BASED ON MATHEMATICAL THEORY AND COMPUTER SCIENCE
PRACTICE; CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ARE DESIGNED AROUND COMPUTATIONAL HARDNESS
ASSUMPTIONS, MAKING SUCH ALGORITHMS HARD TO BREAK IN PRACTICE BY ANY ADVERSARY.
IT IS THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE TO BREAK SUCH A SYSTEM, BUT IT IS INFEASIBLE TO DO
SO BY ANY KNOWN PRACTICAL MEANS. THESE SCHEMES ARE THEREFORE TERMED
COMPUTATIONALLY SECURE; THEORETICAL ADVANCES, E.G., IMPROVEMENTS IN INTEGER
FACTORIZATION ALGORITHMS, AND FASTER COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY REQUIRE THESE SOLUTIONS
TO BE CONTINUALLY ADAPTED. THERE EXIST INFORMATION-THEORETICALLY SECURE SCHEMES
THAT PROVABLY CANNOT BE BROKEN EVEN WITH UNLIMITED COMPUTING POWER—AN EXAMPLE IS
THE ONE-TIME PAD—BUT THESE SCHEMES ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO USE IN PRACTICE THAN
THE BEST THEORETICALLY BREAKABLE BUT COMPUTATIONALLY SECURE MECHANISMS.

THE GROWTH OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC TECHNOLOGY HAS RAISED A NUMBER OF LEGAL ISSUES IN
THE INFORMATION AGE. CRYPTOGRAPHY'S POTENTIAL FOR USE AS A TOOL FOR ESPIONAGE
AND SEDITION HAS LED MANY GOVERNMENTS TO CLASSIFY IT AS A WEAPON AND TO LIMIT OR
EVEN PROHIBIT ITS USE AND EXPORT. IN SOME JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE USE OF
CRYPTOGRAPHY IS LEGAL, LAWS PERMIT INVESTIGATORS TO COMPEL THE DISCLOSURE OF
ENCRYPTION KEYS FOR DOCUMENTS RELEVANT TO AN INVESTIGATION. CRYPTOGRAPHY
ALSO PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT AND COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
OF DIGITAL MEDIA.
