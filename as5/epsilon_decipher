THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA, A SINGLE, PUBLIC PROVINCIAL UNIVERSITY, WAS CHARTERED
IN 1906 IN EDMONTON, ALBERTA WITH THE UNIVERSITY ACT IN THE FIRST SESSION OF THE
NEW LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, WITH PREMIER ALEXANDER C. RUTHERFORD AS ITS SPONSOR.
THE UNIVERSITY WAS MODELLED ON THE AMERICAN STATE UNIVERSITY, WITH AN EMPHASIS
ON EXTENSION WORK AND APPLIED RESEARCH. THE GOVERNANCE WAS MODELLED ON ONTARIO'S
UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO ACT OF 1906: A BICAMERAL SYSTEM CONSISTING OF A SENATE
(FACULTY) RESPONSIBLE FOR ACADEMIC POLICY, AND A BOARD OF GOVERNORS (CITIZENS)
CONTROLLING FINANCIAL POLICY AND HAVING FORMAL AUTHORITY IN ALL OTHER MATTERS.
THE PRESIDENT, APPOINTED BY THE BOARD, WAS TO PROVIDE A LINK BETWEEN THE TWO
BODIES AND PERFORM INSTITUTIONAL LEADERSHIP.

HEATED WRANGLING TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THE CITIES OF CALGARY AND EDMONTON OVER THE
LOCATION OF THE PROVINCIAL CAPITAL AND OF THE UNIVERSITY. IT WAS STATED THAT THE
CAPITAL WOULD BE NORTH OF THE NORTH SASKATCHEWAN RIVER AND THAT THE UNIVERSITY
WOULD BE IN A CITY SOUTH OF IT. THE CITY OF EDMONTON BECAME THE CAPITAL AND THE
THEN-SEPARATE CITY OF STRATHCONA ON THE SOUTH BANK OF THE RIVER, WHERE PREMIER
ALEXANDER RUTHERFORD LIVED, WAS GRANTED THE UNIVERSITY. WHEN THE TWO CITIES WERE
AMALGAMATED IN 1912, EDMONTON BECAME BOTH THE POLITICAL AND ACADEMIC CAPITAL.

WITH HENRY MARSHALL TORY AS ITS FIRST PRESIDENT, THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA
STARTED OPERATION IN 1908. FORTY-FIVE STUDENTS ATTENDED CLASSES IN ENGLISH,
MATHEMATICS AND MODERN LANGUAGES, ON THE TOP FLOOR OF THE QUEEN ALEXANDRA
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN STRATHCONA, WHILE THE FIRST CAMPUS BUILDING, ATHABASCA HALL,
WAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. IN A LETTER TO ALEXANDER CAMERON RUTHERFORD IN EARLY
1906, WHILE HE WAS IN THE PROCESS OF SETTING UP MCGILL UNIVERSITY COLLEGE IN
VANCOUVER, TORY WROTE, "IF YOU TAKE ANY STEPS IN THE DIRECTION OF A WORKING
UNIVERSITY AND WISH TO AVOID THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST, MISTAKES WHICH HAVE
FEARFULLY HANDICAPPED OTHER INSTITUTIONS, YOU SHOULD START ON A TEACHING BASIS."

UNDER TORY'S GUIDANCE, THE EARLY YEARS WERE MARKED BY RECRUITMENT OF PROFESSORS
AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE FIRST CAMPUS BUILDINGS. TODAY, HE HAS A BUILDING NAMED
AFTER HIM THAT HOUSES CLASSES OF ALL TYPES. PERCY ERSKINE NOBBS & FRANK DARLING
DESIGNED THE MASTER PLAN FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA IN 1909–10. NOBBS DESIGNED
THE ARTS BUILDING (1914–15), LABORATORIES AND POWER HOUSE (1914). WITH CECIL S.
BURGESS, NOBBS DESIGNED THE PROVINCIAL COLLEGE OF MEDICINE (1920–21). ARCHITECT
HERBERT ALTON MAGOON DESIGNED SEVERAL BUILDINGS ON CAMPUS, INCLUDING ST. STEPHEN'S
METHODIST COLLEGE (1910) AND THE RESIDENCE FOR PROFESSOR RUPERT C. LODGE (1913).

THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA AWARDED ITS FIRST DEGREES IN 1912, THE SAME YEAR IT
ESTABLISHED THE DEPARTMENT OF EXTENSION. THE FACULTY OF MEDICINE WAS ESTABLISHED
THE FOLLOWING YEAR, AND THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE BEGAN IN 1915. BUT ALONG WITH
THESE EARLY MILESTONES CAME THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE GLOBAL INFLUENZA PANDEMIC
OF 1918, WHOSE TOLL ON THE UNIVERSITY RESULTED IN A TWO-MONTH SUSPENSION OF
CLASSES IN THE FALL OF 1918. DESPITE THESE SETBACKS, THE UNIVERSITY CONTINUED TO
GROW. BY 1920, IT HAD SIX FACULTIES (ARTS AND SCIENCES, APPLIED SCIENCE,
AGRICULTURE, MEDICINE, DENTISTRY, AND LAW) AND TWO SCHOOLS (PHARMACY AND
ACCOUNTANCY). IT AWARDED A RANGE OF DEGREES: BACHELOR OF ARTS (BA), BACHELOR OF
SCIENCE (BSC), BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN AGRICULTURE (BSA), BACHELOR OF LAWS (LLB),
BACHELOR OF PHARMACY (PHMB), BACHELOR OF DIVINITY (BD), MASTER OF ARTS (MA),
MASTER OF SCIENCE (MSC), AND DOCTOR OF LAWS (LLD). THERE WERE 851 MALE STUDENTS
AND 251 FEMALE STUDENTS, AND 171 ACADEMIC STAFF, INCLUDING 14 WOMEN.

THE BRETON SOIL PLOTS WERE ESTABLISHED AT THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE FROM 1929 –
PRESENT TO PROVIDE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH ON FERTILIZATION, USAGE, CROP ROTATIONS
AND FARMING PRACTICES ON GRAY-LUVISOLIC SOILS (GRAY-WOODED), WHICH COVER MANY
REGIONS IN WESTERN CANADA.

THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA SPEARHEADED AN EXTRAORDINARY RATE OF VOLUNTEERISM IN
THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA TO THE FIRST WORLD WAR, ESPECIALLY FROM ITS MEDICAL
FACULTY. EXPERIENCE GAINED WAS USED BY RETURNING VETERANS TO RAPIDLY MATURE
THE YOUNG FACULTY OF MEDICINE. THE WAR MEMORIAL COMMITTEE COMMISSIONED A WAR
MEMORIAL PIPE ORGAN TO BE ERECTED BY THE CASAVANT FRERES IN U OF A CONVOCATION
HALL IN 1925 IN MEMORY OF 80 UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA COMRADES WHO GAVE UP THEIR
LIVES DURING THE GREAT WAR.

IN THE EARLY PART OF THE 20TH CENTURY, PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION EXPANDED BEYOND
THE TRADITIONAL FIELDS OF THEOLOGY, LAW AND MEDICINE. GRADUATE TRAINING BASED ON
THE GERMAN-INSPIRED AMERICAN MODEL OF SPECIALIZED COURSE WORK AND THE COMPLETION
OF A RESEARCH THESIS WAS INTRODUCED. IN 1929, THE UNIVERSITY ESTABLISHED A
COLLEGE OF EDUCATION. THIS PERIOD OF GROWTH WAS TO BE SHORT-LIVED, THOUGH, AS
THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR CURTAILED ENROLMENT AND EXPANSION
UNTIL 1945. THE UNIVERSITY ALSO GAINED NEW PUBLIC POWERS. IN 1928, THE UNIVERSITY'S
SENATE WAS GRANTED THE POWER TO OVERSEE AND APPOINT HALF OF THE ALBERTA EUGENICS
BOARD, CHARGED WITH RECOMMENDING INDIVIDUALS FOR STERILIZATION.

SPURRED BY POSTWAR GROWTH IN THE STUDENT POPULATION AND THE DISCOVERY OF OIL IN
LEDUC IN 1947, THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA UNDERWENT EXPANSION THROUGH THE 1950S
THAT CONTINUED THROUGH THE 1960S AS THE BABY-BOOM GENERATION SWELLED THE
ENROLMENT RANKS. THESE TWO DECADES ALSO SAW EXPANSION OF CAMPUS BUILDINGS,
INCLUDING NEW BUILDINGS FOR THE FACULTIES OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND EDUCATION,
AND THE CAMERON LIBRARY. THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA PRESS, CONCENTRATING ON
WESTERN CANADIAN HISTORY, GENERAL SCIENCE AND ECOLOGY, WAS FOUNDED IN 1969.

THE POLICY OF UNIVERSITY EDUCATION INITIATED IN THE 1960S RESPONDED TO
POPULATION PRESSURE AND THE BELIEF THAT HIGHER EDUCATION WAS A KEY TO SOCIAL
JUSTICE AND ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FOR SOCIETY. IN ADDITION,
THE SINGLE-UNIVERSITY POLICY IN THE WEST WAS CHANGED AS EXISTING COLLEGES OF THE
PROVINCIAL UNIVERSITIES GAINED AUTONOMY AS UNIVERSITIES. ON SEPTEMBER 19, 1960,
THE UNIVERSITY OPENED A NEW 130-HECTARE CAMPUS IN CALGARY. BY 1966, THE
UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED AS AN AUTONOMOUS INSTITUTION.

FROM THE MID-1970S TO THE LATE 1980S, THE UNIVERSITY ENJOYED SUSTAINED GROWTH.
IN 1970, THE COLLEGE SAINT-JEAN BEGAN OFFERING FRENCH-LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION IN
ARTS, SCIENCE AND EDUCATION. IN 1984, THE SCHOOL OF NATIVE STUDIES WAS
ESTABLISHED. BUILDINGS THAT HAD BEEN STARTED IN THE 1960S, SUCH AS BIOLOGICAL
SCIENCES AND THE CENTRAL ACADEMIC BUILDING, WERE COMPLETED IN THE EARLY 1970S.
EXTENSIVE RENOVATIONS RESTORED THE VENERABLE ARTS BUILDING, AS WELL AS THE
ATHABASCA AND PEMBINA HALLS. NEW BUILDINGS COMPLETED IN THE EARLY 1980S INCLUDED
THE BUSINESS BUILDING AND THE FIRST PHASE OF THE WALTER C. MACKENZIE HEALTH
SCIENCES CENTRE. ANOTHER NEW BUILDING, THE DISTINCTIVE UNIVERSIADE PAVILION
(NICKNAMED THE "BUTTERDOME"), WAS COMPLETED AS PART OF THE UNIVERSITY'S
PREPARATIONS TO HOST THE WORLD UNIVERSITY GAMES IN 1983, THE FIRST TIME THE
EVENT WAS HELD IN NORTH AMERICA.

THE 1990S WERE A TIME OF FINANCIAL CONSTRAINT AS THE ALBERTA GOVERNMENT MADE
BUDGETARY CUTBACKS. BUT THEY WERE ALSO A TIME IN WHICH THE UNIVERSITY BENEFITED
FROM PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT. THE $11-MILLION TIMMS CENTRE FOR THE ARTS, WHICH
BEGAN CONSTRUCTION IN 1993, WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY A LARGE DONATION FROM ITS
NAMESAKE, ALBERT TIMMS. IN 1998, GLADYS YOUNG'S $3.5-MILLION DONATION TO THE
UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE SCHOLARSHIP FUND IN MEMORY OF ROLAND YOUNG, WHO
GRADUATED FROM THE U OF A IN 1928, WAS THE LARGEST PRIVATE DONATION FOR
UNDERGRADUATE SCHOLARSHIPS IN THE UNIVERSITY'S HISTORY.

THE EARLY 2000S BROUGHT SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING INCREASES. HIGH ENERGY PRICES DROVE
ALBERTA'S ENERGY BOOM RESULTING IN MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR GOVERNMENT SURPLUSES AND
THE SUBSEQUENT CREATION OF A $4.5 BILLION PROVINCIAL POST-SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL
ENDOWMENT. IN 2005, THE UNIVERSITY HIRED INDIRA SAMARASEKERA AS ITS 12TH
PRESIDENT, EMBARKING ON AN AMBITIOUS PLAN TO ESTABLISH ITSELF AS ONE OF THE
WORLD'S TOP PUBLIC RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES. THESE PLANS WERE HAMPERED BY THE
2008 ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, AND BY LATE MARCH 2008, THE UNIVERSITY'S ENDOWMENT HAD
SHRUNK BY MORE THAN $100 MILLION, ALMOST 14 PER CENT OF ITS VALUE. THE
UNIVERSITY PREDICTED A $59-MILLION BUDGET SHORTFALL IN 2009 BEFORE PROVINCIAL
CUTS BROUGHT THAT FIGURE TO $79 MILLION. TO CLOSE THE BUDGETARY GAP, THE
UNIVERSITY INCREASED NON-INSTRUCTIONAL FEES BY $290 PER YEAR LAID OFF TEACHING
AND SUPPORT STAFF, AND EVEN ELIMINATED PHONES IN SOME DEPARTMENTS (SUCH AS
ENGLISH AND FILM STUDIES).

THE 2013 ALBERTA BUDGET CUT PROVINCIAL POST-SECONDARY GRANTS BY $147 MILLION,
INCLUDING A 7.2 PER CENT CUT TO THE UNIVERSITY'S BASE OPERATING GRANT. THE
UNIVERSITY IS COVERING ITS RESULTING SHORTFALL BY REDUCING TOTAL SPENDING IN
2013 BY $28 MILLION, THEN CUTTING AN ADDITIONAL $56 MILLION TO BALANCE ITS
BUDGET BY THE SPRING OF 2015.

THE 2015 ALBERTA BUDGET RELEASED IN OCTOBER 2015 RESTORED A 1.4 PER CENT CUT TO
THE U OF A'S OPERATIONAL FUNDING, AND PROVIDED FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWO PER CENT
INCREASE IN THE 2015-16 FISCAL YEAR. THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDED A TWO-YEAR
TUITION FREEZE. OCTOBER ALSO SAW THE LAUNCH OF AN INSTITUTIONAL STRATEGIC
PLANNING PROCESS INTENDED TO PROMPT DISCUSSION AND GATHER FEEDBACK ON THE
UNIVERSITY'S STRATEGIC PRIORITIES, WITH THE GOAL OF ASSUMING A NATIONAL
LEADERSHIP ROLE IN POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION.
